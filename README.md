## Description

A simple landing page build with HTML and CSS. Which uses JavaScript to dynamically create nodes base of data attributes. 

To view the project, open `/index.html` with any browser of your choice.

To add more menu items simply add a section in your `/index.html` file and specify data attributes.

## Tips/ Improvements

Only sections with the `data-nav` atrribute would be populated in the nav, hence you need not worry if you did not want to specify a particular section in the nav.
